# Define Your Way

A Dictionary Game - invent definitions for words that are convincing *and* creative.  This is similar to the old-fashioned game where someone flips through a dictionary, and picks a word.  He or she writes down the word and the real definition.  Friends write down the word and made-up definitions.  The person-with-dictionary reads all the definitions in a random order.  People guess which one is the real one.  Scoring is complicated.  Points are awarded for guessing the right answer, and for having other people guess that yours is correct, with a bonus for picking a word that no one ends up guessing correctly.

Scoring in this version is even more complicated.  But this site does all the hard work!  You score points for creativity too...  Details below ... (TODO)
